# Traffiway

Application Traffiway is the final product of my Master's thesis about "Optimization of deliveries using utility vehicle".

The aim of this thesis was to compare algorithms of effective packaging and route calculation to optimize the transport of goods by means of a delivery vehicle. A review of the literature was carried out in terms of existing algorithms for effective packaging, and analysis of the applications for determining routes were conducted. Based on the collected information, selected packaging algorithms have been implemented and tested, based on which they were compared to the problem. The thesis also contains a description of the developed module that is used to determine the order of deliveries. On the basis of the tests carried out, the author of the work prepared an application design for effective supply chain management using a vehicle with N1 approval.
